# GenzelLab_cell_assembly


pipline:

1. Generate the actmat.
2. Do post-processing for the genrated actmat, including: check whether the neruon is pyramid neuron and check whether you need to use "NaN" instead of 0 (TODO)
3. Combine all 5 trials and run cell assembly to get different assembly group and all the other information.
